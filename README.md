pynetdev
========

This library enables users to automate network tasks.  There are plenty
of third party packages that help along the way, which are all mostly
listed in the setup.py.  This connection library also comes bundled with
a script called netautomaton.py, which is a wrapper for most common
functions of pynetdev for easy use.
